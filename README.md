# Ultra_Marathon_USA_Analysis
The project aimed to analyze data from the USA 50km & 50 mi Ultra Marathon 2022 to answer key questions related to participant demographics, gender differences in race performance, and trends in average speed with age variations. By understanding these factors, the project sought to provide insights into peak age for Ultra Marathon participation, gender-based performance gaps, and age-related trends in race speed.
